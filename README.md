# Uncommon Dart Error: Index-Out-of-Bounds Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Dart related to accessing elements in a list outside of its valid index range.  The example showcases a `RangeError` that occurs when an invalid index is used.  The solution demonstrates best practices for handling such exceptions.

The `bug.dart` file shows the error-causing code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a robust solution.
